# this file is blank to demonstrate that you only need to import things in a module's __init__.py if you plan to import this whole module as opposed to one of its files
# ie "import controllers", instead of "from controllers import comments_controller"
# here it's just left blank to show that it's technically possible
# but irl you would want to use this file to package up the contents of this module anyway, even if you weren't sure you needed to import the whole module

# see comments_routes for more info
